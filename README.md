## Centmin Mod Unattended Command Line Install

Fastest method of install and allows fully unattended installation. Just type this command as root user in SSH on a fresh CentOS 7 server. Installation should take between 15-30 minutes on a fast server or up to 50-70 minutes on a slower server depending on server specs and your server's network connectivity and download speed.

As at May 8th, 2022, Centmin Mod versions are undergoing a transition version branch wise:

1. Previous 123.08stable is now moving to 124.00stable. 124.00stable is essentially based on the well tested 123.09beta01 branch. All development and changes made in 123.09beta01 are now in 124.00stable.
2. Previous 123.09beta01 code is now in 124.00stable
3. A new 130.00beta01 branch has started and this is also based off of 123.09ebat01 branch but with additional development and code to eventually support EL8+ operating systems like CentOS 8, Alma Linux 8 and Rocky Linux 8. This branch will take over from 123.09beta01 as the development beta branch. EL8+ operating system support isn't fully complete as at May 8th, 2022. So installation on CentOS 7.x is recommended.
